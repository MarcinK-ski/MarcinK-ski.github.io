      <description>2020 is really weird.
SARS-CoV-2 ðŸ¦  caused, we had to sitting at our homes, with only virtual entertainment. After few months, goverments allows for some events, but with strictly rules ðŸ˜·.
Thats why, Woodstock festival in Poland (nowadays known as Pol&amp;rsquo;and&amp;rsquo;Rock) took place in internet this year. Only small group of lucky guys, won a tickets (Woodstock was never ticketed), rest of us, had to watch festival in the Internet. For these three days my home turns into &amp;ldquo;festival stage&amp;rdquo;.</description>
