      <description>Again Octopus Film Festival took place Gda≈Ñsk‚ùóÔ∏è That was third edition.
First two editions take five days and has one &amp;ldquo;hidden show&amp;rdquo;. This time there was little different (it&amp;rsquo;s ofc caused by COVID-19). There wasn&amp;rsquo;t hidden show, max number of people on each movie was reduced - that&amp;rsquo;s why I missed some projections üò≠
But there was good news too!!! Organizers prepare to us something new - Audience Award for the best move in category &amp;ldquo;Genre Cinema&amp;rdquo; (idk how to translate it properly).</description>

      <description>2020 is really weird.
SARS-CoV-2 ü¶† caused, we had to sitting at our homes, with only virtual entertainment. After few months, goverments allows for some events, but with strictly rules üò∑.
Thats why, Woodstock festival in Poland (nowadays known as Pol&amp;rsquo;and&amp;rsquo;Rock) took place in internet this year. Only small group of lucky guys, won a tickets (Woodstock was never ticketed), rest of us, had to watch festival in the Internet. For these three days my home turns into &amp;ldquo;festival stage&amp;rdquo;.</description>
