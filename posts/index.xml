            <description>In the chilhood, I had blog only once and never thought, I&amp;rsquo;ll create any blog again. ðŸ˜Š About week ago at work, I had to find solution for problem with angular, which I solved half year ago. Digging this same pages led me to fix it.
After that, I wrote message to my friend TehGM about it to let my flustration out. He sugest me to create blog and document how I solve problems.</description>

About week ago at work, I had to find solution for problem with angular, which I solved half year ago. Digging this same pages led me to fix it.</p>
<p>After that, I wrote message to my friend <a href="https://tehgm.net">TehGM</a> about it to let my flustration out. He sugest me to create blog and document how I solve problems.</p>
<p>Ok. So let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<ul>
<li>âœ… Choose and download framework for blog - <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></li>
<li>âœ… Find and get theme - <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/">hello-friend-ng</a></li>
<li>âœ… Set basic configuration and make some theme customizations</li>
<li>âœ… Write something about me and why I created this blog (yeah - the one, you reading right now ðŸ˜„ )</li>
</ul>
<p>But then I thought&hellip; This blog could be great oppurtunity to &ldquo;be in touch&rdquo; with english - why I write this? Becouse of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To warn against grammar mistakes ðŸ˜‰</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll write here not only about my &ldquo;technical problems&rdquo;, but my thoughts and about my hobbies too.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope, you find here something interesting or helpful. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰</p>
