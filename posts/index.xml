            <description>Again Octopus Film Festival took place Gda≈Ñsk‚ùóÔ∏è That was third edition.
First two editions take five days and has one &amp;ldquo;hidden show&amp;rdquo;. This time there was little different (it&amp;rsquo;s ofc caused by COVID-19). There wasn&amp;rsquo;t hidden show, max number of people on each movie was reduced - that&amp;rsquo;s why I missed some projections üò≠
But there was good news too!!! Organizers prepare to us something new - Audience Award for the best move in category &amp;ldquo;Genre Cinema&amp;rdquo; (idk how to translate it properly).</description>

<p>First two editions take five days and has one &ldquo;hidden show&rdquo;. This time there was little different (it&rsquo;s ofc caused by COVID-19). There wasn&rsquo;t hidden show, max number of people on each movie was reduced - that&rsquo;s why I missed some projections üò≠</p>
<p>But there was good news too!!! Organizers prepare to us something new - Audience Award for the best move in category &ldquo;Genre Cinema&rdquo; (idk how to translate it properly). To be sure, everyone will watch each movie in this category, every movie was projected two times - so whole festival took six days.</p>
<p><br>
In my honest opinion, despite the adversitises arising from COVID-19, Octopus Film Festiwal is still great event!</p>

            <description>2020 is really weird.
SARS-CoV-2 ü¶† caused, we had to sitting at our homes, with only virtual entertainment. After few months, goverments allows for some events, but with strictly rules üò∑.
Thats why, Woodstock festival in Poland (nowadays known as Pol&amp;rsquo;and&amp;rsquo;Rock) took place in internet this year. Only small group of lucky guys, won a tickets (Woodstock was never ticketed), rest of us, had to watch festival in the Internet. For these three days my home turns into &amp;ldquo;festival stage&amp;rdquo;.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2020 is really weird.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 ü¶† caused, we had to sitting at our homes, with only virtual entertainment. After few months, goverments allows for some events, but with strictly rules üò∑.</p>
<p>Thats why, <strong>Woodstock</strong> festival in Poland (nowadays known as <em>Pol&rsquo;and&rsquo;Rock</em>) took place in internet this year. Only small group of lucky guys, <strong>won</strong> a tickets (Woodstock was never ticketed), rest of us, had to watch festival in the Internet. For these three days my home turns into &ldquo;festival stage&rdquo;. Ofcorurse, Woodstock is not only a music‚ùó It&rsquo;s meeting with friendly people, meetings as a part of ASP (in strict translation form Polish, it&rsquo;s: Academy of Finest Arts(?) ) and much more. All of that, create wonderful atmosphere - this is what I really missed for  üò≠.</p>
<p>So&hellip; Why it was worth to watch this transmission üõ∞? Because virtual ASP and artists gave to us a litte bit of this atmosphere. To feel it more, I decided to not pause or backward stream. üòâ</p>
<p>In technical breaks between concerts, among others there was shown archived concert, so you could recall your previous festivals or just watch, which bands play then.
After second day, I realized, online festival has few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚úÖ You can watch every concert on festival.</li>
<li>‚úÖ You will watch band even if on real festival, you won&rsquo;t decide on it.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Every artist had only 30 minutes, so in general, they show best songs</li>
<li>‚úÖ You can discover that:
<ul>
<li>song which you know is perdormed by band you know too, but you never connected these facts</li>
<li>band you know, have more cool songs, then you realized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
And now&hellip; Few songs üéµ, which qualify for me to last point of bellow points (i mean point: &ldquo;<em>you can discover that</em>&rdquo; üòâ):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4bAjO071STV32uOpxYvmhZ?si=wacOa6DmRVy8eam4G_s28w">Farben Lehre - Dobranoc</a></p>

            <description>In the chilhood, I had blog only once and never thought, I&amp;rsquo;ll create any blog again. üòä About week ago at work, I had to find solution for problem with angular, which I solved half year ago. Digging these same pages led me to fix it.
After that, I wrote message to my friend TehGM about it to let my flustration out. He sugested me to create blog and document how I solve problems.</description>

About week ago at work, I had to find solution for problem with angular, which I solved half year ago. Digging these same pages led me to fix it.</p>
<p>After that, I wrote message to my friend <a href="https://tehgm.net">TehGM</a> about it to let my flustration out. He sugested me to create blog and document how I solve problems.</p>
<p>Ok. So, let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚úÖ Choose and download framework for blog - <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></li>
<li>‚úÖ Find and get theme - <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/">hello-friend-ng</a></li>
<li>‚úÖ Set basic configuration and make some theme customizations</li>
<li>‚úÖ Write something about me and why I created this blog (yeah - the one, you reading right now üòÑ )</li>
</ul>
<p>But then I thought&hellip; This blog could be great oppurtunity to &ldquo;be in touch&rdquo; with english - why I write this? Becouse of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To warn you against grammar mistakes üòâ</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll write here not only about my &ldquo;technical problems&rdquo;, but my thoughts and about my hobbies too.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope, you find here something interesting or helpful. Enjoy! üéâ</p>
